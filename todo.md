Bugs/errors:
- Need to calculate games analyzed and last updated stats (maybe save this for later)
- Need to do something to speed up time for the site to load, not sure what we are doing wrong here
- Figure out fuzzy search for the entire table
- Figure out sorting so that it doesn't include random tactitians with 0 play rate.

API key request:
- write a nice looking summary of the application
- riot.txt thingy after that.

Next up to do:
- Setup some sort of chron job to automatically runs the match data api
