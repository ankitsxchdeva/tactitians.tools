Bugs/errors:
- Need to calculate games analyzed and last updated stats (maybe save this for later)
- Need to do something to speed up time for the site to load, not sure what we are doing wrong here
- Figure out fuzzy search for the entire table
- Figure out sorting so that it doesn't include random tactitians with 0 play rate.

API key request:
- write a nice looking summary of the application
- riot.txt thingy after that.

Next up to do:
- Setup some sort of chron job to automatically runs the match data api
- Fix the fuzzy search with some library
- Figure out how the process will update for a new champion
    - Maybe write some sort of python thing that will let you add another little legend without much work 
    

Images:
- Click to expand or something like that
- Host locally and make the images webp or something that actually works
- Fix the bug for Apprentice Sprite image not being there

Meta project things to do:
- Make a nice and readable readme
- Maybe add contribution guidelines as well?
- Not sure if I open source this but something like that could be cool I think
- Apply for prod api code 
- Fix file structure and make it look really nice as well
