Bugs/errors:
- Need to adjust collect_match_data to ignore any games that have bots in them
- Need to calculate games analyzed and last updated stats (maybe save this for later)
- Default sort should be by number of games played
- Need to do something to speed up time for the site to load, not sure what we are doing wrong here



Next up to do:
- Setup some sort of chron job to automatically runs the match data api
